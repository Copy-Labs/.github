## Hi there 👋
WELCOME TO COPY LABS

We believe that you cannot innovate a technology until we understand the technologies. That's why we are building Copy Labs.

VISION:
Copy Labs is a Lab that rebuild existing technologies so that we can understand them as we build and afterward IMPROVE THEM.

MISSION:
1. Begin a Technological Innovation Spree in 5 years due to the better understanding of existing technology of today.
2. Have 1000 copied and improved difficult existing technology tools, apps and products that exist today.


THE GOAL is to use the same Strategy other countries and companies have used to improve their Businesses and Economy. They copy until they begin to improve which leads to them eventually innovatating. This will obviously take time, but it works.

In 5 years, we aim to have the manpower, knowledge and the technological know-how to begin to innovate more and improved technology.
